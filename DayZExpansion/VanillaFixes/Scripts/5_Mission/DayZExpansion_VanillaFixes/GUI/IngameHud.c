{
	//! @note DayZ Experimental 1.19 update from 2022-10-24 made a not-modding-friendly change
	//! that introduced the bug of always showing vehicle HUD (even vanilla) in inventory menu.
	//! In the *hopefully* (AHEM) unlekliy event that this bug makes it to DayZ stable (AHEM),
	//! just uncomment the below commented out code and REMOVE the super.
	//! 2022-10-26: Bug made it to stable :/
	override void SetLeftStatsVisibility(bool visible)
	{
		//super.SetLeftStatsVisibility(visible);  //! REMOVE this super call if uncommenting below code

		m_LeftHudPanelWidget.Show(visible);
	}
